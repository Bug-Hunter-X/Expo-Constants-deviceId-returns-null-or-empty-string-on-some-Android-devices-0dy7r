# Expo Constants.deviceId Returns Null or Empty String on Some Android Devices

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's `Constants.deviceId` API where it returns `null` or an empty string on certain Android devices and emulators. This inconsistency makes it difficult to reliably identify devices for tasks requiring unique identifiers.

## Problem

The `Constants.deviceId` API is expected to provide a unique identifier for each device. However, in some cases, it returns `null` or an empty string, making it unreliable.

## Solution

A solution is provided in `bugSolution.js` that utilizes a combination of approaches to improve the reliability of obtaining a unique device identifier. This may involve falling back to other methods such as generating a UUID if `Constants.deviceId` fails to provide a valid identifier.
