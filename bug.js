This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.deviceId` API to get the device's unique identifier.  In some cases, particularly on Android emulators or certain Android devices, the `deviceId` returns `null` or an empty string instead of a unique identifier. This makes it impossible to reliably identify the device for tasks like personalized settings or data synchronization.  The inconsistency in the behavior across different Android devices and emulators makes debugging and resolving this issue challenging.
